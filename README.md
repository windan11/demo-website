# fictional-sniffle-demo

What: Demo Website

Purpose: Demo website created for design &amp; branding company to showcase their works and ideas

Why: I created this project to practice my skills for front-end web development, and using Github and Git. The website is nowhere in completion to how I wanted to look, but it is a start. In each part of the website is an inspiration from other websites that I wanted to try to replicate (i.e. hero section such as in dropbox, footer section in Airbnb, and many more.) 

I welcome suggestions and constructive criticisms to make my code better and efficient. There is still much for me to learn and I am welcome any ideas. 

EDIT:

12/17/17: As a self-taught learning front-end, I rely heavily on guides, tutorials, readings, and practices. That means that this project contains code mostly that is NOT my own. Some of it will be mine. I will credit what I learn on my original file- particularly in section that I rely heavily on the tutorials/other developer's code.
